### Village North

14. Why is it always so cold up here? The grass is still green! we don't have any snow! What's going on?!
15. Something strange is going on in this town. Just an intuition--maybe I'm wrong! Yeah! I'm probably wrong!
16. Dear Tom,
When are you coming back? I keep hoping you'll be finished with harvest season and come back to me.
Love,
Lucy
17. To the Reader:
I have a hypothesis about what's happening. Can you guess what it is? If you think you know, come to the Castle north of the village square.
From:
The Writer

### Castle

18. A Knight, to guard his kingdom from potential attackers, took the power of a mysterious artefact.
19. He brought that artefact into his little kingdom. He used it's powers to create peace for all his subjects.
20. There was a cost to this peace however. A barrier of silence may stop evil, but does it not also stop good?
21. To the Reader:
You know don't you? We cannot see anyone from outside, and anyone from outside cannot see us. There is a way to resolve this, but can I ask you, a stranger, to rescue us?
From:
The Writer

### Sanctum

22. Touching this artefact will release all the residents of this kingdom from invisibility--But you yourself will become invisible.
23. You can still leave. You haven't touched it yet. Don't make decision you will regret. I've regretted what I did to this kingdom ever since we found it, fallen from the sky.
24. No one will force you. You do not owe us anything.
25. Reader, what will you choose?
