# April Game Collaboration

It's 3D, and it's in Godot. It's an adventure game of sorts, with puzzles.

Don't read the rest of this if you don't want spoilers.

# Developer Notes

- 60 minutes target play time; with 20% travel time (12 minutes), that gives us ~48 minutes of gametime.
- Average player takes, on average, 1-2 minutes per puzzle; so we need roughly 24 puzzles.
- Timeline is fantasy but with sci-fi elements mixed into it
- Theme is empathy/morality
- Protagonist grew up hearing legends/stories about a hidden kingdom, a forgotten place where all is peaceful. When he grows up, he decides to find it.
- Everyone in the kingdom became invisible for some reason. One of the townspeople at least knows/understands this, and is trying to make contact with the "outer world."
- Completing each puzzle nets you a note from one of the invisible people giving a hint about the next piece of a larger puzzle.
- Need to develop in such a way that adding more elements in the future is as easy as possible.
