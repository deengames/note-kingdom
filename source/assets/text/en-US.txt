NOTE_18: A Knight, to guard his kingdom from potential attackers, took the power of a mysterious artefact.
NOTE_19: He brought that artefact into his little kingdom. He used it's powers to create peace for all his subjects.
NOTE_20: There was a cost to this peace, however. A barrier of silence may stop evil, but does it also stop good?
NOTE_21: To the Reader:\nYou know don't you? My subjects and I are invisible. There is a way to resolve this, but can I ask you, a stranger, to rescue us?\nFrom:\nThe Writer
NOTE_22: Touching this artefact will free all the people of this kingdom from invisibility--But you yourself will become invisible.
NOTE_23: You can still leave. You haven't touched it yet. Don't make decision you will regret. I've regretted what I did to this kingdom ever since we found it, fallen from the sky.
NOTE_24: No one will force you. You do not owe us anything.
NOTE_25: Reader, which will you choose?
